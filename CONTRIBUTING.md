## What does contributing mean to Dovedit?

For the Dovedit project, contributing means more than just writing code.
Dovedit is a community project, and it needs all kinds of help to
achieve its gaols. Contributing to Dovedit means:

* Writing documentation
* Fixing bugs
* Adding features
* Spreading the word
* Creating artwork
* Contributing financially
* Helping others
* Reviewing content
* Reviewing code and pull requests

In this document, we'll go through the different ways you can contribute
and establish the guidelines for each one.

### Source code contributions

The production code is hosted at the `main` branch. The latest commit
in the `main` branch is the one that the public sees. Pull requests
should be made against the `main` branch.

How you name your pull requests is up to you. But commit mesages should
be descriptive and clear. If you're fixing a bug, you should include
the issue number in the commit message. If you're adding a feature,
you should include a description of the feature and why it's needed.
